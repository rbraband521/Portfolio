# Rachel Braband's Portfolio

The landing page displays information about each project. When clicked, you are directed to more information about each project as well as a link to a Live Demo and the GitHub Repo. There is also a biography page where you can learn a little more about me and my journey to computer programming.

## Built with:
  * Node.js
  * Express.js
  * Pug templates

***** 

##### I used Pug templates which utilize JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser
##### There is a data.json file which holds all the data about each project
##### The project is deployed through Heroku: a Procfile was required as well as a little port configuration in the app.js file
